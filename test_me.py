# Project File

"""
This file serves as Dominick Bellofatto and Joe Eacott's CS2005 project.

The purpose of this file is to analyze NBA shot attempt information for a specific player
to create a model of shot makes/attempts. This statistic is called FGA, or field-goal-attempts,
which determines another statistic, which is FGM. These two statistics will give us a percentage
of how a player typically does scoring-wise for a game.

We can use this information to predict when a player may have above average night for shooting,
which people like to refer to as a "hot" game. We'll formally define a "hot" game as shooting
more than 7% above a player's average.

    ::Note seaborn will crash and to fix, you must make these changes to:
site_packages > seaborn > rcmod.py

1. Add the following import statement:
import cycler

2. Change line 492 to this instead:
matplotlib.rcParams['axes.prop_cycle'] = cycler.cycler(color=colors)
